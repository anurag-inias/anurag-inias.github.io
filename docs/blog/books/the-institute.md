Since I DNF'd this one, I don't have much to say except for being a negative Nancy. 

This felt unoriginal and overly familiar. I initially enjoyed the opening chapters with Tim, when the story's direction was still unclear. A former cop, hitchhiking on a whim, ends up taking the job of a night knocker in a backwater town â€“ it had a promising start.

The nosedive came right as the genius kid is introduced. King appears to be cheating here. Writing kids is hard, so lets make this kid a prodigy and have him talk like a man in his 30s. Throw in telekensis and mind reading for the heck of it. I dropped right after the first chapter of the abduction. Checked the Wiki, and yes, this was going exactly where I expected it going.

It felt too formulaic, especially for a story written in 2019, three years after _Stranger Things_, which is a much better distillation of King's own ideas

P.S. Stranger Things peaked in Season 1.
