I read this in Oct 2024, to get some spooks in. I prefer paranormal and Lovecraftian horror, so this seemed right up my alley. I didn't read the synposis, and just from the titled expected it to be a loose anthology of paranormal ghost stories.

This novel turned out to be more about the host of the fictionalized _Ghost Radio_ podcast. The whole story centered around him, and his deceased friend. 

tl;dr: the story follows two kids from different families who are orphaned in a road accident. They meet in the hospital and quickly bond over their shared loss. Together, they form a band and achieve some underground notoriety. An accident during one of their performances, leads to the death of one of the friends. The survivor eventually starts a podcast about paranormal encounters. This act inadvertently summons the ghost of his deceased friend, who is furious at the perceived sellout.

It's better than my brief summary suggests, yet somehow also worse. The premise is original, definitely compared to my other reads this month. But the story focus on the podcast host and his descent (to madness?) didn't give me the scares I was looking for.  The best chapters were the in-universe stories shared by the podcast listeners â€“ those were genuinely creepy.

Ultimately, I came out of this unsatisfied and a bit bored. What made it a unique take on "Ghost Radio" also made it a middling read.
