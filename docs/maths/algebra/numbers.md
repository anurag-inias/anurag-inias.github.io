## Common numbers sets

- $\mathbb{N} = \lbrace0, 1, 2, 3, ...\rbrace$, are called natural numbers.
- $\mathbb{Z} = \lbrace ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\rbrace$, are called integers.
- $\mathbb{Q} = \lbrace\dfrac{p}{q} \text{ where }p, q \in \mathbb{Z} \text{, and }q \not = 0\rbrace$, are called rational numbers.
- $\mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q}$, are called irrational numbers.

## Rational and Irrational numbers

Rational numbers can be expressed as quotient or fraction $\dfrac{p}{q}$ of two integers, where the denominator is non-zero. Alternatively, rational numbers are real numbers whose decimal expansion either terminates after finite number of digits (e.g. $1,2345$) or repeats a finite sequence (e.g. $\dfrac{1}{7} = 0.\overline{142857}$).

Irrational numbers are real numbers which cannot be expressed ratio of two integers. Alternatively, these are real numbers with non-terminating non-repeating decimal expansion. e.g. $\sqrt 2, \sqrt 5, \pi$ etc.

## Factors & Primes

- $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$ are called _factors_ of $ab$.
- If the only factors of a number $a$ are $a$ itself and $1$, then $a$ is called a _prime number_, e.g. $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...$
- Every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ can be written as a product of prime factors, e.g. $126 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 7$.
- The _highest common factor_ or _greatest common divisor_ (GCD) of two natural number is the largest factor they have in common, e.g.

$$
\begin{alignat}{1}
144 & = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \\
66 & = \hspace{5.2em} 2 \hspace{1.7em} \times 3 \times 11
\end{alignat}
$$

- _Lowest common multiple_ (LCM) of $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$ is the smallest natural number that can be divided into whole number by both $a$ and $b$.

$$
\text{lcm}(a, b) = \dfrac{|ab|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
$$

## Fractions and ratios

- $\dfrac{a}{b}$ is a _proper fraction_ if $a < b$, otherwise its called an _improper fraction_.
- $6\dfrac{2}{3}$ is an example of a mixed fraction.
- Two factors can only be added or subtracted if they share a _common denominator_, which is the LCM of the two denominator. e.g. $\dfrac{1}{4} + \dfrac{2}{4} = \dfrac{3}{4}, \dfrac{2}{3} + \dfrac{1}{5} = \dfrac{10}{15} + \dfrac{3}{15} = \dfrac{13}{15}$.
- Ratio _one-to-two_ is written $1:2$, where $a:b$ is equivalent to fractions $(\dfrac{a}{a+b}, \dfrac{b}{a+b})$.
